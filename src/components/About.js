    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Hello, and thanks for reading!
      <br/>
    I am a full stack developer who loves seeing projects from inception to completion. My background in professional theatre has prepared me for team collaboration and creative problem solving. I am passionate about reading, love discussing films (especially anything by David Lynch), and have an addiction to the game Animal Crossing (please send help).
    </p>
    <p>Likes: Books, Twin Peaks, beaches, kombucha, and placing first in Mario Kart.
      <br/>
    Dislikes: Avengers movies, asparagus, gender roles, and the texture of chalk.</p>
